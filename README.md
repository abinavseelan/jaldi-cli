# jaldi

CLI utility to quickly bootstrap projects. ⚡️

jaldi supports and clones the following starter projects:

- [React, Express & Node with Hot Module Reloading](https://github.com/abinavseelan/React-Express-Node-Starter)

## Installation

Install the cli tool globally.

```bash
npm install -g jaldi
```

## Usage

```bash
jaldi <path-to-clone-starter-project-to>
```

This will clone the [default starter project](https://github.com/abinavseelan/React-Express-Node-Starter) to the specified path.

## Yet another bootstrapping tool?

jaldi (which is Hindi for quickly ⚡️) aims to remove the hassle of bootstrapping new projects, without being opinionated in project approach or abstracting away control from the developer.

jaldi creates the boilerplate that every developer needs to set up in the first 15 minutes of starting a project and then gets out of your way ... completely.

## Future scope

- Support more starter projects!
